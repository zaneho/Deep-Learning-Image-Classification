# Image Classification Transfer Learning with Inception v3

**Project for Deep Learning Workshop**

----------------------

Aim: Use transfer learning to train the InceptionV3 model and classify 10 different Monkey species with images as the dataset.


Transfer learning is a machine learning method that utilises pre-trained neural network, such as Inception-v3 (Image recognition model).
It is used to extract features using a convolutional neural network and does classification using fully connected and softmax layers.
